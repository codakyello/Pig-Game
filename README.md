# Pig-Game
The goal of this interactive game is to be the first player to reach a specified score. With each turn, players roll the dice, accumulating points along the way. But beware, rolling a 1 resets your current turn score! Strategy comes into play as you decide whether to keep rolling for higher scores or play it safe and hold.
